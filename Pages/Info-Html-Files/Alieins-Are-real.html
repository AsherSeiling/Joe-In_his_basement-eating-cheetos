                Aliens are so totaly real! One time my friend 
                Joe's cusin saw a UFO land in a feild. He said 
                that aliens came out of the UFO and took him in 
                and tried to errase his memory of it happening. 
                Aliens are some of the collest things ever 
                because they are so much more powerful than us and 
                could wipe us out in one blow. On the internet 
                there are so many videos of UFOs that they are 
                undenyably real. Anchient Aliens clearly proves 
                that aliens are real. I got a C+ in math so you 
                should trust me on this. There are so many planets 
                in the universe that it is just statisticly 
                probable that there are aliens out  there and they 
                have vieited earth. It's not like Aliens would 
                introduce themselves to us its obvious that they 
                would hide. The govement has been hiding Aliens in 
                Area-51, Edwards Air force Base, and in so many 
                other locations. The navy even found UFOs flying 
                over the ocean and they confirmed it was real. 
                That big-foot on Mars picture NASA took was totaly 
                an Alien! Would a rock have looked like bigfoot? 
                ALiens are so real.
