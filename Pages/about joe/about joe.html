                Hello I'm Joe and I love Cheetos! I live in my
                moms Basement and make this website to help make 
                the world a better place. I am 28 and live in 
                Massachusetts and a graduate from Wohescer 
                Community College. I was born in 1992 in Nashville 
                Illinois. I attended Nashville High School where I 
                graduated with a 2.5 GPA. I used to work for 
                Cheetos before I got fired for hacking into the 
                mainframe to get a coupon code that would let me 
                eat Cheetos for free. I currently reside in my 
                momâ€™s basement and make this awesome website.
